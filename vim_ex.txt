forward by two words. This works with all commands.

Try to move from the point marked with an 'A' above it through the other
capital letters of the alphabet im one command (e.g. 3e or 2w).

       A           B
e stands for the end of the word.

w means word, that is, move to the next word.

C                    A             B
use 0 to jump to the first character of the line.

A                                B              C
Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten

        C          A                        B
        ^ moves to the first non-whitespace char on a line 

A                          $

I said a hip hop, hippie to the hippie 
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie
A host, of golden daffodils;
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
